			<h1>Release Builds</h1>
			<p>Release builds are versioned, e.g. 0.9.9, and are published
					periodically, usually every few months. They represent stable
					snapshots of libgdx. Note that new bug fixes and features are never
					backported to old libgdx releases.</p>

			<h1>Nightly Builds</h1>
			<p>Nightly builds are created every night, and on every change
					in the Git repository, by our build server. They contain the latest
					and greatest bug fixes and features. Nightlies are usually very
					stable, just like our master branch on Github.</p>

		<h2>Contents of a Release/Nightly</h2>
		<p>
			Each release/nightly contains a bunch of jar files and native library that are
			necessary for a multi-platform libgdx project. The <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-setup%2C-running-%26-debugging">Gdx
			Setup UI</a> takes care of managing your dependencies. If you want to setup things manually, here's a <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Manual-project-setup">guide</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Git Tags</h2>
		Starting with version 0.9, we have created tags for each release in the Git repository. You can use these to check the source
		of a specific version.
		<h2>Special Xamarin Release</h2>
		We released a special Xamarin Release for libgdx version 0.9.9 for users that are still using Xamarin instead of RoboVM. You can download
		it <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/releases/libgdx-0.9.9-xamarin.zip">here</a>. You can find the corresponding Git tag
		<a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/tree/0.9.9-xamarin">here</a>. We removed all traces of the Xamarin backend after this Git tag, and
		will not backport any fixes. We strongly recommend to use the RoboVM backend instead.
